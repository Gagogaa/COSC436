	 The tag= contains the name of the affiliate.
	 The "tags" in the URL seem to be separated by &.

2) The machines in 520 can open an sftp connection provided you use an application that
	 supports sftp, such as filezilla or the sftp command line application.

	 I think that some of the differences are in the technologies powering the search.
	 Google may be using GO, and Microsoft might be using php or its own in house technology.
	 
6) Google search for Gir

	 The most time consuming part of the response by far was the initial message from Google. It took 934ms to receive the response.
	 742ms of that time was spent receiving the document.

	 The next time consuming response was a GET request for some images that took 98ms.

7) No, I cannot see the php source code.

8) Simple web page analysis

	 HEADERS:
		1. In a request the user sends an AGENT string so when a login page tells you that your xyz is out of date
			 part of that comes from AGENT string. It's also how download pages know what operating system your running.
		2. The request header also contains cookies. I think this is one of the reasons why sessions use cookies.

	 RESPONSE:
		1. Web pages can be broken down into many files that the USER/CLIENT can easily parse for information.
		2. After the initial page load subsequent requests (for images and things) don't need to establish a
			 new connection. This can be seen by the DNS resolution time and connection time in the html response.
			 The subsequent request for the image has no DNS resolution time and no connection time.

	 TIMING:
		1. Most of the browsers time is spent waiting for a response.
		2. Images (due to size) take longer to retrieve from the server.
